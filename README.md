# OpenPlySplice-analysis

This project analyzes the Open Ply Splice defect occurring in the tire manufacturing process, with a focus on understanding its frequency, potential causes, and contributing factors. The defect is critical as it affects product integrity and often leads to increased scrap or rework costs.

Data was collected from production logs and quality inspection records within the material preparation area. The analysis was conducted using Python, primarily with pandas for data manipulation, matplotlib and seaborn for visualization, and NumPy for basic statistical evaluation.

The workflow includes:

-Data cleaning and preprocessing

-Exploratory data analysis (EDA)

-Time-based trend identification

-Correlation analysis between machine states, material types, and defect occurrence

-Visualization of defect distribution across shifts, machines, and time periods

The goal was to support quality and reliability teams by providing data-driven insights into how and when Open Ply Splice defects are most likely to occur. 

Results highlight specific patterns and recurring issues that can guide process improvements and preventive actions.

This analysis is part of a broader effort to enhance defect tracking, increase first-pass yield, and reduce quality-related waste in tire production.
